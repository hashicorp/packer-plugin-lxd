# LXD Builder

Type: `lxd`
Artifact BuilderId: `lxd`

The `lxd` Packer builder builds containers for LXD. The builder starts an LXD
container, runs provisioners within this container, then saves the container as
an LXD image.

The LXD builder requires a modern linux kernel and the `lxd` package. This
builder does not work with LXC.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example.

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "lxd",
      "name": "lxd-xenial",
      "image": "ubuntu-daily:xenial",
      "output_image": "ubuntu-xenial",
      "publish_properties": {
        "description": "Trivial repackage with Packer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

@include 'builder/lxd/Config-required.mdx'

  ~> Note: The builder may appear to pause if required to download a
  remote image, as they are usually 100-200MB. `/var/log/lxd/lxd.log` will
  mention starting such downloads.

### Optional:

@include 'builder/lxd/Config-not-required.mdx'
